				<h5>Skills From Industry</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>I have always worked alongside completing my education, therefore this has greatly improved my work ethic, time management, communication, and working as a team and independently. </p>
					<p>All of my industry skills have come from the service industry however many of these skills are very transferable. </p>
					<p>I have also done some small freelancing jobs for logo and banner designs for websites and small businesses.</p>

				<h5>Coding Skills</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>Throughout University and college, I have learned how to code front end websites with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  </p>
					<p>The most important aspect of coding I have learned is to follow the coding standards and comment on your code, making it much easier for developers to edit, or add content.</p>
					<p>I have also learnt how to implement back end features such as databases and retrieving and sending data to a database.</p>

				<h5>Skills from Education</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>Whilst studying at Edghill University and West Lancashire College, I have learnt how to create high fidelity wireframes using software such as Figma.</p>
					<p>I have also studied the laws that govern web technologies such as the Data Protection and Misuse Act. This is great for protecting personal data.</p>
					<p>Education has taught me the most popular project management methods and how to use them within my projects, such as Agile, Scrum and the Waterfall Method.</p>

				<h5>Edge Tree Surgery</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>A project brief, with data for the website and some layout ideas, was given. The information and design ideas have been implemented into the final website.</p>
					<p>Wireframe and high fidelity designs were created before any coding, this helped with keeping the layout of the website consistent with the brief.</p>
					<p>The website consists of information provided by Rising Falcon, navigation bar, small picture gallery and user form. The mobile view has been implemented but isn't complete.</p>

					<p>A small project brief, with information for the site and images to be added, pencil and paper wireframe designs were created.</p>
					<p>The website is simple, with one main page and no navigation, other pages can be navigated from the text links around the website.</p>
					<p>Relevant information is positioned appropriately on the page, for example, the ticket prices and donations are at the top of the page. Making it easier for customers to find the information needed.</p>
